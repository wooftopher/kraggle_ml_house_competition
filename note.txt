Gradient Boosting Machines (GBM):

    Adds robustness to complex patterns and interactions in the data.

    Complements XGBoost and LightGBM with a different boosting approach.

Support Vector Regression (SVR):

    Effective for capturing non-linear relationships.

    Adds diversity to your stacked model.

Neural Networks (MLPRegressor or simple Keras model): 
        MAYBY ONE DAY XD TOO MUCH ENV I NEED A NEW CLEAN WITH CUDA

    Can model highly non-linear relationships.

    Adds a different learning paradigm to the mix.

K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN):

    Captures local patterns in the data.

    Adds a distance-based perspective.

Bayesian Ridge Regression:

    Provides probabilistic predictions and handles uncertainty well.

    Adds a Bayesian approach to your ensemble.
